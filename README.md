# GUISSHGenerator
GUI Tool  that saves on having to type out tons of  using bash shell
The code  consists of a header file dialog.h and its corresponding implementation file dialog.cpp. The code is a  Qt application and includes several Qt libraries for various functionalities. Let's go through the code and explain its purpose and structure.

dialog.h:

    The header file starts with include statements for various Qt libraries used in the code.
    It defines a class Dialog that inherits from QDialog, which is a Qt class representing a dialog window.
    Inside the Dialog class, there are private member variables, including pointers to the user interface (UI) and other necessary variables.
    The class also declares several private functions and private slots (slots are Qt's way of defining event handlers).
    At the end of the header file, there is an #endif directive to close the conditional compilation block.

dialog.cpp:

    The implementation file starts with include statements, including the corresponding header file and additional Qt libraries.
    The constructor Dialog::Dialog initializes the UI, sets up connections between UI elements and slots, and creates instances of QProcess for executing commands.
    The destructor Dialog::~Dialog deletes dynamically allocated variables and cleans up resources.
    The function Dialog::showMessage displays a message box with the provided message, title, and message type.
    The function Dialog::saveSettings saves user email and password details to a settings file.
    The function Dialog::saveDetails is called when the user clicks the "Save Details" button and validates and saves the user's email and password details.
    The function Dialog::loadDetails is called when the user clicks the "Load Details" button and loads email and password details from the settings file.
    The function Dialog::handleClose is a slot called when the dialog is closed, and it performs necessary cleanup tasks.
    The function Dialog::processStartProcess is called when the user clicks the "GenSSH" button and starts the process for generating an SSH key.
    The function Dialog::writeCommands is called when the user clicks the "OK" button and writes the entered commands to the process for execution.
    The function Dialog::addKeyToAgent is called when the user clicks the "AddSSH" button and adds the SSH key to the agent.
